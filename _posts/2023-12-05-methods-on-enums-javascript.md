## Introduction
One of the most fundamental things that we do as software engineers is take enumerable data and manipulate it to server the purpose or a program, system and end user. At a basic level, an enumerable is just something that is able to be counted. Across various programming languages and paradigms, enumerables can be called many things and can take many forms such as hashes, lists, arrays, and various other collections. These are called data types and they are foundational to being a highly effective programmer. In fact, excellent algorithmic design can be said to rest on two facets, 
```
1. Selecting the correct structure(s) for some set of data
2. Selecting the correct method(s) run against that data structure
```

In this article, we will look some of the frequently used data structures in JavaScript and the common methods used to manipulate the data they hold.

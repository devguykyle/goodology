# Introduction
I have recently been reading through `Algorithmic Design` and wanted to distill some of the great information I have gleaned about solving problems in code and thinking about implementation details more clearly.

The book doesn't claim to be exhaustive concerining algorithmic design but it does do a good job of outlining 3 critical algorithmic types: 
  1. greedy
  2. divide and conquer
  3. dynamic programming
